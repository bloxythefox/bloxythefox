### Hello

# I'm a small coder who works on projects in their spare time.

> Anything here is likely either a passion project, or a School related project.
> 
> I prefer coding in Java, but look forward to learning C and other similar languages.
> 
> While I have worked on it in the past, I do NOT enjoy working on HTML, CSS, or Javascript. 

For anyone who wants to know: My pronouns are He/Him/They/Them (I'm not picky on how most people refer to me.)
